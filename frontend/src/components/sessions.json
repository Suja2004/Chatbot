This session will take about 5-10 minutes. Find a quiet place where you can relax.\nStart by sitting comfortably. Take a deep breath in, hold for a few seconds, and then slowly exhale. Let’s repeat this a few times, focusing on the sensation of your breath entering and leaving your body. Feel your chest and belly rise and fall with each breath.\nNow, let's focus on the present moment. Look around the room and name 5 things you can see. Notice the colors and shapes. Next, name 4 things you can touch. Feel their texture. This exercise helps you feel grounded in the here and now.\nThink of a recent situation where you felt anxious or overwhelmed. Notice what thoughts come to mind. Are these thoughts based on facts or assumptions? Gently challenge them. Replace negative thoughts with a more balanced perspective. For example, instead of 'I can’t handle this,' try 'I have faced challenges before, and I can get through this too.'\nNow, let’s repeat a positive affirmation: 'I am capable, and I have the strength to overcome challenges.' Say it out loud or in your mind. Let these words sink in as you take another deep breath.\nThank you for completing this session. Remember, practicing mindfulness and challenging negative thoughts regularly can help manage mild PTSD symptoms. Take your time as you transition back to your day."

This session will take about 5 minutes. Make sure you're in a comfortable and quiet space.\nStart by focusing on your breath. Inhale slowly through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and exhale gently through your mouth. Let your breath relax your body with each cycle.\nNext, we will practice progressive muscle relaxation. Start by tightening the muscles in your toes and feet for a few seconds, then slowly release. Move up your body, tightening and releasing each muscle group: your legs, stomach, hands, arms, shoulders, and face.\nNow, take a moment to reflect on something positive from your day, no matter how small. It could be a moment of calm, something you’re grateful for, or a personal achievement. Allow that positive feeling to fill your mind.\nTo conclude, take a few deep breaths again. As you exhale, imagine releasing any remaining tension. When you’re ready, slowly bring your awareness back to the present."

Make sure you're in a comfortable, quiet space.\nLet’s begin with a few deep breaths. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for a moment, and then slowly exhale through your mouth. With each breath, feel your body becoming more relaxed. Take your time with this.\nThink of a situation where you felt afraid or anxious. What thoughts crossed your mind at that moment? Now, let’s challenge those thoughts. Ask yourself: 'Are these thoughts based on facts?' 'Is there another way to look at this situation?' Replace any negative or irrational thoughts with more balanced and positive ones.\nNext, we’ll take small steps towards confronting a memory that triggers your PTSD. Imagine the memory, but from a distance, like you're watching it on a screen. As you do, notice your feelings. It’s okay if you feel discomfort—just acknowledge it. Repeat this exercise until the intensity of your feelings lessens. You are safe now, and you’re in control of this process.\nTake a moment to visualize a peaceful place where you feel safe and calm. It could be a real place or one you’ve created in your mind. Picture yourself there now, surrounded by peaceful sights and sounds. Focus on how relaxed you feel in this place.\nGreat job completing this session. Remember, gradual exposure to memories and challenging negative thoughts can reduce their power over time. Practice this technique as needed, and always reach out to a professional if you need support."

Think of a way you can view the situation more positively or neutrally. How can you change the thought to help you heal?\nTake a moment to appreciate the strength it takes to work through these thoughts. You are making progress, even if it doesn’t always feel like it."

Start by describing the memory in detail—what happened, where you were, and how you felt. It’s important to remember that this is a controlled exercise, and you are safe now.\nAs you reflect on the memory, notice the emotions it triggers. Now, imagine you are telling your story from a place of strength. Focus on the ways you’ve survived and the lessons you’ve learned. You have the power to rewrite the narrative of this experience.\nTake a moment to see the memory as part of your life story, not as something that defines you. You have faced challenges and continued to move forward. Remind yourself that you are resilient, and you are not defined by the trauma you’ve experienced.\nNow, let’s end with a positive affirmation: 'I am strong. I am healing. I have the power to overcome this.' Repeat this affirmation as many times as needed, allowing it to reinforce your sense of strength.\nThank you for completing this session.
